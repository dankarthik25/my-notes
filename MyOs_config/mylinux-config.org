Advanced Package Tool (or APT),
-  APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, and Debian-based Linux Distributions.[4]
- APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.[4]

* Customize TERMINAL 

To have same customize in bash profile and bashrc 
bash profile : It is customized for evey terminal 
bashrc : It is customized for evey login 

#+begin_src sh
#cat .bash_profile
if [-f ~/.bashrc]; then # if file exist 
   source ~/.bashrc     # then run bashrc
fi
# OR you can run 
[-n "$PS1"] && source ~/.bashrc;
# So we can have single customization file both bash_profile and bashrc
#+end_src


#+begin_src sh
[ -r "$file"] && [-f "$file"] && source  "$file";
# -r FILE   #FILE exists and read permission is granted
# -f FILE   #FILE exists and is a regular file

# If file "EXISTS, REGULAR" and "READ" 

 
#+end_src
My bashrc file 
#+begin_src 
#cat ~./bashrc
PS1='->'
#PS1='-Customize->'
#PS1="\u@\h \W->";
export PS1;

# Special Characters:
#\h   hostname up to first 
#\n   newline
#\s   name of shell
#\t   current time in 24-hour format
#\u   username of current user
#\w   current working directory
#\W   basename of current working directory
#+end_src


# If you google search dotfile : these are customized setting of users in github


* Troubleshoot in ssh connection disconnect

#+begin_src 
 ~.   - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)
 ~B   - send a BREAK to the remote system
 ~C   - open a command line
 ~R   - request rekey
 ~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)
 ~^Z  - suspend ssh
 ~#   - list forwarded connections
 ~&   - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)
 ~?   - this message
 ~~   - send the escape character by typing it twice
(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)
~. to terminate the connection
~^Z (press ~ then Ctrl+Z) to suspend the connection and type a command locally (run the command fg to return to the SSH session)
#+end_src

SSH offers a keep-alive facility. Add the following to your local ~/.ssh/config (create if it doesn't exist):
#+begin_src 
ServerAliveInterval 15
ServerAliveCount 3
#+end_src


While this doesn't actually answer the question it may help reduce the effects of a connection hang: when I'm working remotely (and even usually when I'm not) I run through screen (with or without the byobu wrapper depending on its availability) so that if there is any sort of connection drop my session, with all its history, is preserved and available in the state I left it when I reconnect.
